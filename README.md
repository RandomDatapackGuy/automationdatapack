Autopack is a datapack that is supposed to add both more automation and more random interesting items to the game. Its essentially just me adding whatever the hell I feel like.

In order to impliment the datapack into a new world do the following
1> Launch minecraft in the latest 1.17 snapshot version
2> Download autopack.zip
2> Go to create a world and click the datapacks button
3> Click the open pack folder button and put packbeta.zip into it
4> It should show up in the avalable section after so just enable it then finish creating the world as normal

In order to add it to an existing world do the following
1> Launch minecraft in the latest 1.17 snapshot version
2> Download autopack.zip
3> Select the world you want to add it into then click edit
4> Click open world folder
5> Put packbeta.zip into the datapacks folder

I'll be trying to update this on at least a weekly basis adding some new planned and currently unplanned content so if you try this out and enjoy it check back often.
