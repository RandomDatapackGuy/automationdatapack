tellraw @a[scores={changelog=1}] {"text":"v0.2 Changelog:\nAdded Item - \"Ambience Device\" Makes different ambient particles based on whats put in it\nFixed bug - Pearl stasis chamber will leave ender pearls floating when destroyed\nFixed bug - Teleporter will teleport you when next to it instead of on top\nMisc - Split main tick function into 2 functions\nFixed bug - Synthesis chambers could be broken by pushing them with pistons\nAdded Crafting Table Recipie - 4 Brown Mushroom > Brown Mushroom Block\nAdded Crafting Table Recipie - Brown Mushroom Block > 4 Brown Mushroom \nAdded Crafting Table Recipies - Ability to undo all block crafting recipies (for instance Clay block > 4 Clay Ball)\nGeneral Change - Unlocks all recipies for all players permanantly\nAdded Item - \"Item Compressor\" Turns items into their block forms automatically\nAdded Item - \"Zues\" Crossbow that shoots an explosive lightning bolt\nAdded System - Added the ability to spawn custom mobs that abide by a mobcap and spawn/despawn naturally\nAdded Mob - \"Wraith\" Shadow mob that drops flint,bonemeal, and copper\nAdded Mob - \"Piglin Warrior\" Very fast and hard hitting pigman that spawns in warped forest drops diamonds\nAdded Mechanic - Shulkers respawn in end cities\nAdded Mob - \"Stalker\" Fast end creeper than has a short fuse time but only 5 hp\nAdded Mob - \"Ender Golem\" Slow aggressive golem that flings you high into the air on hitting\nAdded Mob - \"Ender Crawler\" spider that applies blindness and wither on hit\nAdded Mob - \"Shulker King\" just a stronger but much more rare shulker, drops extra shells\nFixed Bug - Custom mob spawning system now follows the doMobSpawning gamerule\nAdded Mob - \"Warped Entity\" A poisonous shulker from the warped forest\nAdded Mob - \"Crimson Entity\" A withering shulker from the crimson forest\nAdded Mob - \"Soulless Entity\" A slowing shulker from the soul sand valley\nAdded Mob - \"Crimson Mooshroom\" An aggressive mooshroom from the crimson forest\nAdded Mob - \"Skeletal Rider\" A skeleton mounted on a skeleton horse from the soulsand valley\nAdded Mob - \"Aerial Marksman\" A flying skeleton from the soulsand valley\nGeneral Change - The mob cap will now increase based on the number of players on the server\nNotes and future plans:\nIf you can't tell by the lack of mob variety and many biomes/structures missing mobs I am not even close to done with the custom mobs.\nCurrently my plans are to add another 2-3 mobs to every unfinished nether biome, 5 night hostile mobs, 1 cave exlusive hostile mob, 1 daytime hostile mob, and 3 passive mobs to the overworld.\nI also plan to give every naturally spawning structure in the game with the exemption of villages one of it's own uniqe mobs similar to the shulker king in the end cities. (though the shulker king is really boring I can assure you the others will be more interesting.)\nI also am going to be implimenting 2 tiers of armor in between vanilla armor and orichalcum as now that the enemies are much more difficult there will be a lot more struggle to get endgame gear.\nAlso for the meantime before other hostiles are added to the overworld the entirety of the 40 mob cap will be taken up by wraiths so I have lowered it to 10 base for the meantime\nOther than that if you look at the spreadsheet with all the items on it the new mobs are on a new tab."}
