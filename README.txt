Autopack is a datapack that is supposed to add both more automation and more random interesting items to the game. Its essentially just me adding whatever the hell I feel like.
Recently updated to v0.2 look below for changelog

In order to impliment the datapack into a new world do the following
1> Launch minecraft in 1.17
2> Download autopack.zip
2> Go to create a world and click the datapacks button
3> Click the open pack folder button and put packbeta.zip into it
4> It should show up in the avalable section after so just enable it then finish creating the world as normal

In order to add it to an existing world do the following
1> Launch minecraft in 1.17
2> Download autopack.zip
3> Select the world you want to add it into then click edit
4> Click open world folder
5> Put packbeta.zip into the datapacks folder

I'll be trying to update this on at least a weekly basis adding some new planned and currently unplanned content so if you try this out and enjoy it check back often.

Notes and future plans:
If you can't tell by the lack of mob variety and many biomes/structures missing mobs I am not even close to done with the custom mobs.
Currently my plans are to add another 2-3 mobs to every unfinished nether biome, 5 night hostile mobs, 1 cave exlusive hostile mob, 1 daytime hostile mob, and 3 passive mobs to the overworld.
I also plan to give every naturally spawning structure in the game with the exemption of villages one of it's own uniqe mobs similar to the shulker king in the end cities. (though the shulker king is really boring I can assure you the others will be more interesting.)
I also am going to be implimenting 2 tiers of armor in between vanilla armor and orichalcum as now that the enemies are much more difficult there will be a lot more struggle to get endgame gear.
Also for the meantime before other hostiles are added to the overworld the entirety of the 40 mob cap will be taken up by wraiths so the overworld is going to be wraith hell for now.
Other than that if you look at the spreadsheet with all the items on it the new mobs are on a new tab.
